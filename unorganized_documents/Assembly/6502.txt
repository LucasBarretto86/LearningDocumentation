* Chapter 1
* Bits and bytes

1 bit holds one time 1 or 0; 
1 byte holds eight times 1 or 0;
1 byte holds one character composed by 8bits, ASCII standards
1 byte holds maximum value of 255  in decimal

Thus, 1024 bytes or 1kb holds 8192 bits.

* Memory

Memories are chips used connected to the processor to storage data or programs that are currently in execution, every bit in the memory has an address, for instance the first bit address is 0, however it doesn't mean that the number 0 is storage on it, it's just a memory address. Usually memory addresses uses four-digits hexadecimal numbers as the standard for the address, exemplo = $0001 or $FFFF

* Registers

A register os a veru small storage area, most of the registers only can storage one byte, but couple of them are two bytes long. The 6502 registers we gonna study are A(Accumulator), X, Y Stack Pointer(ST), Program Counter(PC) and status.

* General Purpose Register
The A register is called accumulator because it's used for simple arithmetics. for instance if you want do a addition, first you need to send to the accumulator de inicial value and then add a new value to the current value on the accumulator.
The A register has only one byte and it's called general-purpose register, the maximum value it holds are 1 byte, which means 255 in decimal number


X and Y registers are also general-purpose registers that holds 1 byte, the generally are refered to index registers, use to assit the index of memory address using loop instructions.

* Special Purpose Registers

* Stack Pointer (SP)

Stack Pointer (SP), is a register that points the current top of the stack in memory, consider the memory as a stack of plates, where the first plate goes to the bottom and the last to come in is piled up to the previous plates on the stack, so the last to come in is the first to come out (LIFO - Last in, First out), coz the SP is always pointing to the top, the top of the stacks has the lowest address and the bottom has the highest address, in every new entry on the stack memory the SP is decreased or decremented after the data is stored and every removal from the stack the SP is increased or incremented point to the next data address, thus the SP is always poiting what data in memory is the next on the top of the stack.

	 ------
	| NONE | ---> Address 0100
	 ------
	~      ~
	 ------		
 SP --->| NEXT | ---> Address 01FB ---> Top of Stack
	 ------
	| DATA |
	 -------
	| DATA |
	 -------
	| DATA | ---> Address 01FF
	 -------

In the 6502 the memory address are always 2 bytes long, but the stack must be in a part of memory where the addresses begin with 01, the SP holds only 1 byte which is the second byte of the address, thus if the SP points 25, actually the top of the stack will be $0125.

* Program Counter (PC)
The program counter is a double (two-bytes-long) register that tell the computer what to do next.
A computer program is made up of a serie of instructions stored in the memory when the program is executed, those instructions are executed one at time. As each instruction is picked up from the memory for execution, the memory address of the first byte of the next instruction is stored in the program counter register. When an instruction has finished executing, the program uses the PC to find where to pick up the next instruction using a JUMP instruction. 


* Status Registers, FLAGS

The status of the registers is treated as eight separate bits, seven of the bigs are used as FLAGS or indicator, if a FLAG bit contains a 1, the FLAG is ON or 'SET'. If it contains a 0, the flag is OFF or 'CLEARED'. The FLAGS are SET or CLEARED as a result of operations such as addition, subtraction or any change to a register. They tell about the result of the operation, such things as if a result is positive or negative, or if the register is overflowed or not. There are many instructions that can access the values of the FLAGS.

 -----------------
|N|V| |B|D|I|Z|C|
 -----------------
N = NEGATIVE = Chapter 11, used for signed numbers. Tells you about the high-order bit of a result.
V = OVERFLOW = As the negative flat it is useful when dealing with signed numbers.
B = BREAK COMMAND = Show whether an interrupt is caused by an external event or by a program command.
D = DECIMAL = tells the microprocessor whether it is doing binary or decimal arithmetic.
I = INTERRUPT DISABLE = Tells the microprocessor whether it's alright to process an interrupt immediately.
Z = ZERO = Shows whether the result is zero.
C = CARRY = Shows whether an arithmetic operation need to carry or borrow outside of the result byte. which means that if the result of the operation needs more than one byte to be fulfilled:
	%0010 0011 = $23 = 35 = Carry on  = C = 1	
	%0000 1010 = $0A = 10 = Carry off = C = 0

* Decimal Number System

Decimal number system has a base of then, which means we count it in groups of ten. Any number bellow 10 is called single:

2 groups of ten <----
	            |
	   ---------|---------
	  |   ---  ---  ---   |	
	  |  | 1 || 2 || 5 |  |------> is written 125
	  |   ---  ---  ---   |
	   ----|---------|----
	       |         |
	       |         ------> 5 singles
               v  
	10 groups of ten tens

Decimal goes from 0 to 255, 255 in binary represents 11111111 = 1 byte 
Binary goes from 0 to 1 = 0, 1 = 1 bit
Hexadecimal goes from 0 to F = F in binary represents 1111 = 4 bits 

*binary - Has base 2 (0-1)
11 = 1 group of 2 + 1 single, thus 11 = 3.

*hexdecimal - Has base of 16
11 = 1 group of 16 + 1 single, thus 11 = 17. 

*Binary to Decimal
First you need to complete the binary number, if the number is bellow eight digits, you have to insert 0 to the left until it gets 8 digits, for instance a %110111, it has 6 digits, so we need to add two 0 on the left, thus 00110111, then we need to set our conversion table using the power of 2 (since binary is based in 2) like bellow:    

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

After we need fill each of those columns, from left to right with a digit from the binary we want to convert also from left to right

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  0  0  1  1 0 1 1 1
_____________________

Now that our table is filled, we have take the decimal values from each column where the corresponded binary is 1, and then sum all those values:

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  0  0  1  1 0 1 1 1
_____________________ 
       32+16 + 4+2+1 = 55

The result will be: %00110111 = 55.


Hexdecimal to Decimal

To convert a Hexadecimal to a decimal, first we need to convert the letters in numbers, for instance AA5B:

B = 11
5 =  5
A = 10
A = 10

Then for each row, we gonna multiply the number for a relative power of 16:

B = 11 * 16^0 = 11*   1 =    11
5 =  5 * 16^1 =  5*  16 =    80
A = 10 * 16^2 = 10* 256 =  2560
A = 10 * 16^3 = 10*4096 = 40960

After we have to sum the results, 11 + 80 + 2560 + 40960 = 43611.

The result of $B5AA = 40960. 

 
* Hexdecimal Number System

The hexdecimal exists as a go-between decimal and binary, coz sometimes is needed to use binary instead of decimals, but binary isn't friendly and it's easy to make mistakes, in this case we use hexdecimal, coz each
digit in hex represents 4 bits, for instance; F in hex = 1111 in binary, so to represent a caracter we would need 2 digits insteado of 8.

1 character = 1 byte
2 hex = 1 byte
8 bits = 1 byte
 
Hex and binary are directly related, to comunicate with the machine the hexdecimal number system is the closest we can get before the binary itself, it's easy to the computer convert hex to binary, all the work is done in binary on the moment of execution, so it's a very fast process.

The computer also prints some data in hexdecimal, including memory address information and machine language instructions, after the program has been assembled, compiled, but internaly it's all written in binary.

In 6502 Assembly Language, we usually indicate a binary number by the prefix % and a hexadecimal number by the prefix $; a decimal number has no prefix.

A binary is based on two and hexdecimal is based in 16, Since 2^4 (2 elevated to 4) is 16, there's a direct relationship between a group of four binary ditigs and 1 hexdecimal digit.

$3 = %0011	|	%1010 = $A
$9 = %1001	|	%1000 = $8
$A = %1010	|	%0101 = $5
$C = %1100	|	%1111 = $F
 

Covert betweeb larger binary and hexdecimal values is also simple, if a binary is larger than four digits, divide it into groups of four digits:

	 ------------------- 
	|  -   ----   ----  |
	| |1| |0010| |0101| | = %0001 0010 0101  
	|  -   ----   ----  | = $   1    2    5
	 ------------------- 

Binary to HEX:
%101110	 = %0010 1110 = $2E
%1111000 = %0111 1000 = $78
%10000	 = %0001 0000 = $10

You also can convert in the opposite direction, from a HEX to binary, also use groups of four digits, since each Hex digit means 4bits, you just convert each single Hex digit to binary:

$23 = %0010 0011 / same as: %00100011
$FB = %1111 1011 / same as: %11111011
$67 = %0110 0111 / same as: %01100111


*Decimal to Hexdecimal:
The first step is to discover the closest power of 16 (Hexdecimal base is 16) to the decimal value we need to convert, let's use 9983 as example:

16^0 = 1
16^1 = 16
16^2 = 256
16^3 = 4096, next power would be above 65000, so in this case we gonna use 16³.

So next we divide 9983 by 4096, while our coefficient isn't 0 we only gonna take assume our coefficient as the Hex number, considering that the result will come out from left to right in this case 9983/4096 = coefficient = 2, rest = 1791, since it's coefficient isn't 0 we take our first number as 2.
 
The second step is to do a new division from the rest of the previous division, in this case 1791, by the closest power of 16, which is 16² = 256, thus 1791/256 = coefficient = 6, rest = 255, same as the first step the coefficient value isn't 0, so we must consider the second result as 6.

The third step is exactly the same process take the rest from the previous division and divide by the closest power for 16, which means 255/16 = Coefficient = 15, rest = 15, again the coefficient isn't 0 so our third number is 15.

For the last number we start very much on the same way, but if we try to divide the rest from the previous division our coefficient would be 0, in this case we assume our forth number as the rest itself, 15.
     
Total result is: 2 6 15 15 

Remember that in Hex value above 9 and bellow 15 uses alfabet; A, B, C, D, E, F.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |  A |  B |  C |  D |  E |  F |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Result is: 26FF 
Hex from 9983 is = 26FF 

*Decimal to Binary:
Decimal to Binary workds basically on the same way as decimal to hexdecimal, but we use power of 2, coz binary has base of 2. For this example let's use the decimal number: 55.

First we need to find what is the closest power of 2 to our decimal number 55; 

2^0 =  1
2^1 =  2
2^2 =  4
2^4 =  8
2^5 = 16
2^6 = 32, that is the closest we can get, because 2^7 would be 64; 

Now we divied 55/32 = coefficient = 1, rest = 23. Our first number is 1 

Now we take the rest 23/16 = coefficient = 1, rest = 7. Our second number is 1

Take the rest 7 and divide by 8, since the result would be 0,875 we take our next number as 0 and the rest will remain 7, since 0*8 = 0 and 7-0 = 7;

Since our previous division already have used 2^4, we have to try the next another power of 2 bellow 2^4, in this case it would be 2^2=4, so we take the rest 7 and divide by 4, 7/4 = coefficient = 1, rest = 3, then our forth number will be 1.

Now we take the rest from the previous division which is 3 and divide by the closest power of 2, which is 2^1 and divide it, 3/2 = coefficient = 1, rest = 1, our fifth number is 1

Once again we take the rest and try to divide by a power of 2 bellow 2^1, which would be 2^0 = 1, and divide our rest, 1/1 = coefficient 1; rest 0.
Our sixth number is also 1 and since the rest is 0, our calculation is over.  

So the final result will be 110111; the binary number of 55 is 110111.
